import {SideBySideImages} from "../../../src/components/SideBySideImages";

I saw a [cool
blogpost](https://dev.to/mariusmuntean/build-the-game-of-life-with-react-5goh)
on creating Conway's game of life in TS, and I thought it'd be fun to
compare the implementation to what I'd write in Clojurescript.



## The Cell

Starting with the smallest component, the cell.  It's either alive or
dead. And it needs to be toggleable back and forth between those states.

import cellTs from './cell-ts.png'
import cellCljs from './cell-cljs.png'

<SideBySideImages sourceLeft={cellTs} sourceRight={cellCljs} />

The TS version starts with an enum for `Dead` or `Alive`, and a class
representing a cell with a few methods on it. 

 The Clojurescript version is just a keyword.  It's just data -
either `:dead` or `:alive`.  And because maps implement `Ifn`, I can
just use a map for the toggling function.

Besides the complexity of the mechanism itself, the TS version is also
mutable.  Cells can themselves switch back and forth, they maintain an
internal state.  The cljs version has no such state.

## Life (the board)

There's a more substantial divergence here because the TS version is
using a `Life` class to represent the game and the board, which aren't
decomplected in that version.  For my cljs version, the game logic is
stored in a `tick` function, while the board exists as an independent
entity.

import initialTs from './initial-state-ts.png';
import initialCljs from './initial-state-cljs.png';

<SideBySideImages sourceLeft={initialTs} sourceRight={initialCljs} />

To handle the different cases of initialization, I used multiple
implementations with different numbers of arguments.  I also put the
state into a reagent atom, which will let the React component this is
a part up update reactively to changes in the state.

The boards themselves ended up being pretty similar, except for where
Cells are different.

## Board toggling

Because the TS version is using more complicate data structures, it
needs a method for toggling state of a particular cell on the board.

The cljs version just uses a generic function.

import toggleTs from './toggle-ts.png';
import toggleCljs from './toggle-cljs.png'

<SideBySideImages sourceLeft={toggleTs} sourceRight={toggleCljs} />

## Tick

Tick is the most interesting function in the whole project.  Neither
of these functions look nice to me, but I think the Clojurescript one
wins in a few places that falls out of our design.  First off, we've
avoided some iteration and tracking around what the next state will
be.  We don't need to track it because our board isn't mutable.  I can
map over the board and update whatever I want without breaking the
next step, something the TS version can't do (without expensive
copying).

I think the biggest win comes from `get-neighbors`.  The TS version is
awkward and wordy.  Clojurescript's `for` macro lends itself very well
to an elegant solution to a problem that would otherwise take a lot of
edge case checking.

I also think it's a win that all these functions became distinct. One
of the strong suits of Clojure I've found is that it is easy to take a
chunk of code and isolate it in a method.  And the `?` character being
allowed in names makes predicates easy to define and communicate about.

import tickTs from './tick-ts.png';
import tickCljs from './tick-cljs.png'

<SideBySideImages sourceLeft={tickTs} sourceRight={tickCljs} />

## Conclusion

The Clojurescript code is smaller in every case, which is nice.  But
the constructs I can use to build the same thing are drastically
simpler. 

Becuase I don't need to track states across time (because of immutable
persistent data structures), I can use simpler representations.  I can
skip on the class and just use plain data.  Because of those simpler
representations, I can skip out on using concrete methods on
particular classes and instead opt for generic functions that work on
everything. 

Because there are more powerful functions, I can skip some verbosity of
looping. 

Clojurescript offers drastically improved building blocks compared to
Javascript.
