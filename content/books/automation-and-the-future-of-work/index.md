## -In Progress-


The "automation discourse" contends that work and humans are being made
obsolete by advanced machines. Mainstream people who talk about it claim we're
experiencing a paradigm shift that means humans will no longer need to work in
the near future and we should therefore institute some kind of UBI or negative
income tax.

Benanv disagrees, saying automation machines lack the ability to do basic things
like fold laundry, and cannot do what they do now unattended. He instead
believes the changes we're seeing in the world are the result of low labor
demand globally. He claims this is a continuation of a long trend and that
automation discourse arises in any historical time when labor demand shrinks too
far from labor supply.

## 4 Main Points

Benanav outlines 4 main points in his introduction to talk about.

1. Decline in demand for labor is not due to "unprecedented" changes, but a
   consistent changes combined with "deepening economic stagnation".
2. The lack of demand is primarily manifested as underemployment, and not
   unemployment.
3. The elite members of society benefit from cheap labor, and are therefore
   unlikely to rush to fix what will be perceived by most people as a problem
   (and certainly not guaranteed to want to fix it.)
4. The problem of how to create a fully automated world where people can thrive
   in freedom and creative pursuit is more a social problem than a technical
   one.
